## Frontend Integration Guide

### Error Handling Pattern

```typescript
try {
  await contract.create_escrow(params);
} catch (error) {
  const errorCode = parseContractError(error);
  switch(errorCode) {
    case 1: // AmountBelowMinimum
      showError(`Minimum amount required: ${await getMinAmount(token)}`);
      break;
    case 6: // Unauthorized
      showError('You don\'t have permission for this operation');
      break;
    case 7: // ContractPaused
      showError('Contract is paused. Please try again later.');
      break;
    // ... handle other errors
  }
}
```

### Error Code Parsing

```typescript
function parseContractError(error: any): number {
  // Soroban error format may vary
  const errorString = error.toString();
  const match = errorString.match(/Error: (\d+)/);
  return match ? parseInt(match[1]) : -1;
}
```

#### Error 87: StaleAdminRevision
**Description**: The caller supplied an admin revision that does not match the current monotonic revision. No storage was written.

**Triggering Conditions**:
- `apply_admin_mutation(expected_revision, …)` where `expected_revision != get_admin_revision()`
- The supplied revision is neither the current head nor the revision that already applied this exact fingerprint

**Suggested Client Action**:
1. Call `get_admin_revision()` and retry with the fresh value
2. Re-read platform config before constructing a different mutation

---

#### Error 88: AdminActionAlreadyApplied
**Description**: This admin mutation was already applied at the supplied revision. Replaying it cannot repeat its effect.

**Triggering Conditions**:
- Retry of `set_paused`, `update_platform_fee`, `apply_admin_mutation`, or another gated admin write with the same arguments after a successful apply
- `apply_admin_mutation` with the revision that already consumed this fingerprint

**Suggested Client Action**:
1. Treat the call as a successful no-op for idempotent clients
2. If a different outcome is required, submit a new mutation at `get_admin_revision()`

---

## Version History

| Version | Date | Changes |
|---------|------|---------|
| 1.1 | 2026-08-31 | Added `StaleAdminRevision` (87) and `AdminActionAlreadyApplied` (88) for revision-bound admin mutations (#1071) |
| 1.0 | 2026-08-25 | Initial catalog creation from error enum |
