## 1. Upgrade Permission Model

### Who can propose an upgrade?

Any address in the **UpgradeSigners** list may call `propose_upgrade_wasm`. If no explicit list has been configured, the **platform admin** is the sole default signer — providing a safe, backward-compatible baseline (effective threshold = 1).

```
UpgradeSigners list (if configured)
  └─ One call per signer per WASM hash
  └─ Approvals accumulate until threshold is met

Fallback (no list configured)
  └─ Admin address is the implicit single signer
```

The signers list is managed exclusively by the admin via `set_upgrade_signers`. Passing an empty list reverts to the admin-only default.

### Who can execute an approved upgrade?

Only the **admin** may call `execute_upgrade`. Even after a proposal has been fully approved and the cooldown period has elapsed, a non-admin caller cannot trigger execution. This separates the approval panel (signers) from the execution key (admin).

### Who can cancel an upgrade?

Only the **admin** may call `cancel_upgrade_wasm`.

### Permission summary

| Action | Required Caller |
|---|---|
| `propose_upgrade_wasm` | Any address in UpgradeSigners (or admin if no list set) |
| `set_upgrade_signers` | Admin only |
| `set_upgrade_threshold` | Admin only |
| `set_wasm_upgrade_cooldown` | Admin only |
| `execute_upgrade` | Admin only |
| `cancel_upgrade_wasm` | Admin only |
| `get_upgrade_proposal` | Anyone (read-only) |
| `get_upgrade_approvals` | Anyone (read-only) |
| `get_upgrade_history` | Anyone (read-only) |

---

## 2. Voting Threshold Requirements

The upgrade process uses an **M-of-N multi-signature** model:

- **N** is the number of addresses in the UpgradeSigners list.
- **M** (the threshold) is configured via `set_upgrade_threshold` by the admin.
- Default threshold is **1** (single-signer, admin-equivalent baseline).
- The threshold must be `>= 1`; setting it to 0 is rejected with `Error::InvalidFee`.

### How approval accumulation works

Each signer calls `propose_upgrade_wasm` with the **exact same `new_wasm_hash`**. Approvals are stored canonically under `DataKey::UpgradeSignerApproval(nonce, signer)` so each signer can count at most once for a given proposal revision (#1059). Integrity checks:

1. **No duplicate approvals** — a second call from the same signer returns the stable error `Error::AlreadyApproved`. The keyed slot and the in-round `approvals` vec both reject the duplicate.
2. **Count cannot exceed the signer set** — after a unique signer is recorded, `approvals.len()` is bounded by the snapshotted `signers` list. Excess approvals are rejected with `AlreadyApproved`.
3. **Approval events identify revision and signer** — every accepted approval emits `UPG_APPR` (`UpgradeApprovalEvent`) with `nonce`, `signer`, `wasm_hash`, and `approval_count`.

Once the threshold is reached, the proposal is **committed**: the `WasmUpgradeProposal` record is stored on-chain, the round accumulator is cleared, and the cooldown clock starts. The event `UPG_PROP` is emitted in addition to the last `UPG_APPR`.

Only **one proposal may be pending at a time**. Attempting to propose while one already exists returns `Error::UpgradeProposalExists`.

### Zero-hash rejection

The hash `0x00…00` (32 zero bytes) is always rejected with `Error::InvalidUpgradeHash`. This prevents accidentally deploying a blank or uninitialized WASM image.

---

## 3. Cooldown and Anti-Bypass Timers

The upgrade system enforces three independent time-based gates, all defaulting to **7 days** (604 800 seconds):

| Timer | Constant | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Execution cooldown | `DEFAULT_WASM_UPGRADE_COOLDOWN` | 7 days | Mandatory review window between approval and execution |
| Cancel-repropose cooldown | `CANCEL_REPROPOSE_COOLDOWN` | 7 days | Prevents cancelling a proposal to immediately re-propose and skip the review window |
| Admin recovery delay | `ADMIN_RECOVERY_DELAY` | 7 days | Timelock before a fallback admin can complete a recovery |

### Execution cooldown

When a proposal is committed (threshold reached), `upgrade_at` is set to `proposed_at + wasm_upgrade_cooldown`. The `execute_upgrade` call will fail with `Error::UpgradeCooldownActive` if the current ledger timestamp is still before `upgrade_at`. This gives the community and operators time to inspect the proposal and cancel it if it is malicious or unintended.

The cooldown can be adjusted by the admin via `set_wasm_upgrade_cooldown`, but only affects **future** proposals. Any currently committed proposal retains the `upgrade_at` timestamp calculated at proposal time.

### Cancel-repropose cooldown (Issue #618)

Without this protection, an admin could cancel a proposal immediately after it was made (avoiding the review window), then re-propose the same hash — bypassing the cooldown entirely. The `LastUpgradeCancelledAt` timestamp is recorded on every cancel. Any new `propose_upgrade_wasm` call within 7 days of the last cancellation is blocked with `Error::UpgradeCooldownActive`.

---

## 4. Executing a Committed Upgrade

Once the cooldown has elapsed, the admin calls:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
  --network <NETWORK> \
  -- \
  execute_upgrade \
  --expected_wasm_hash <HEX_HASH>
```

The `expected_wasm_hash` parameter is a **defense-in-depth check**: the contract verifies that the hash the admin claims to be executing matches what is actually stored on-chain as the pending proposal. This prevents a scenario where the admin's signing tool presents a different hash than what was approved (e.g., a UI spoofing attack or a race condition). If the hashes do not match, `Error::InvalidUpgradeHash` is returned and no upgrade occurs.

On success:
- The new WASM is deployed to the contract via Soroban's `update_current_contract_wasm`.
- `ContractVersion` is incremented by exactly 1.
- An `UpgradeRecord` (previous version, new version, WASM hash, admin address, timestamp) is appended to `UpgradeHistory`.
- The pending proposal is cleared atomically.
- The `UPG_EXEC` event is emitted on the `wasm_upgrade` topic.

---

## 5. Cancelling an Upgrade

The admin may cancel a pending proposal at any time before execution:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
  --network <NETWORK> \
  -- \
  cancel_upgrade_wasm
```

If no proposal is pending, the call returns `Error::NoUpgradeProposed` rather than silently succeeding — making accidental double-cancels visible. Cancellation records the timestamp in `LastUpgradeCancelledAt` to enforce the cancel-repropose cooldown (see §3). The `UPG_CANC` event is emitted so cancellations appear in the audit trail alongside proposals.

---

## 6. Emergency Lock-Out Procedures

### 6.1 Emergency pause

The admin can immediately halt all escrow operations (fund creation, release, refund, dispute, batch operations) by calling:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
  --network <NETWORK> \
  -- \
  set_paused \
  --paused true
```

The public read-only `is_paused()` query returns the current pause bit as a boolean. It reads the same `PlatformConfig::is_paused` value used by write guards, requires no authentication, and returns `false` before initialization. When `is_paused` is `true`, escrow creation, release, refund initiation, dispute initiation, staking, and recurring cycle releases return `Error::ContractPaused` (code 15). Read-only views remain available. Admin/arbitrator paths needed to *clear* emergency conflicts — dispute resolution, upgrade cancel, fund sweep, and admin recovery — stay reachable while paused. Emits the `platform_paused` event.

To resume normal operations:

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <ADMIN_KEY> \
  --network <NETWORK> \
  -- \
  set_paused \
  --paused false
```

Emits the `platform_unpaused` event.

**Use the pause mechanism when:**
- A malicious upgrade proposal has been committed and you need time to cancel it before the cooldown expires.
- An exploit is being actively exploited and you need to freeze escrow state while investigating.
- A planned maintenance window requires freezing new fund movements.

### 6.2 Blocking a pending upgrade

If a committed proposal has not yet reached its `upgrade_at` timestamp, the admin can cancel it via `cancel_upgrade_wasm` (§5). The 7-day cancel-repropose cooldown then prevents the cancelled payload from being immediately re-proposed.

### 6.3 Admin key compromise — recovery procedure

If the primary admin key is suspected to be compromised, the **fallback admin** can initiate recovery. The fallback admin is set during contract initialization (or after an admin transfer) and stored under `DataKey::FallbackAdmin`.

Recovery is a two-step process:

**Step 1 — Initiate the timelock:**

```bash
stellar contract invoke \
  --id <CONTRACT_ID> \
  --source <FALLBACK_ADMIN_KEY> \
  --network <NETWORK> \
  -- \
  recover_admin_access \
  --recovered_admin <NEW_ADMIN_ADDRESS>
```

On first call the contract records `current_time + 7 days` as `AdminRecoveryTime`, emits an `admin_recovery_initiated` event, parks an `AdminRecovery` emergency operation in `Executing`, auto-pauses the platform, and returns **`Ok(())`** so the timelock persists (Soroban reverts all storage writes when a contract returns `Err`).

**Step 2 — Complete recovery after 7 days:**

After 7 days have elapsed, repeat the identical call. The contract verifies:
- The recorded cooldown is at least `MIN_ADMIN_RECOVERY_COOLDOWN` (7 days) — direct writes to storage that attempt to shorten the delay are rejected.
- The current ledger time has passed `AdminRecoveryTime`.
- No active disputes, pending WASM upgrade, or active recurring escrows remain (otherwise `Error::EmergencyConflictActive`).

On success, the admin is updated to `recovered_admin`, the timelock entries are cleared, the emergency operation is marked `Completed`, and the `admin_recovered` event is emitted. The platform remains paused until an explicit `set_paused(false)`.

Calling `recover_admin_access` again before the timelock elapses returns `Error::AdminRecoveryFailed`. Operators can abort a parked recovery with `abort_emergency_operation`.

**Security properties of admin recovery:**
- The fallback admin alone cannot instantly seize admin rights; the 7-day window allows the legitimate admin to respond.
- The minimum cooldown floor is enforced in code, not just in storage, preventing direct-write bypasses.
- The `recovered_admin` address is validated; it cannot be the contract's own address.

### 6.4 Unified emergency operations framework

Pause, admin recovery, fund sweep, and upgrade execution are serialized through an on-chain emergency operation lock so they cannot interleave unsafely.

| Kind | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `Pause` / `Unpause` | Takes the lock for the duration of the call; unpause is rejected while recovery/sweep is `Executing` |
| `AdminRecovery` | Parks in `Executing` across the 7-day timelock; blocks sweep/propose/unpause until completed or aborted |
| `Sweep` | Requires clear dependencies; moves only `balance - TotalLocked - TotalStaked` |
| `UpgradeExecute` / `UpgradeCancel` | Audited; propose/execute are blocked while a fund-emergency lock is held. Cancel remains available so operators can clear upgrade conflicts |

**Dependency gate** (recovery and sweep): no pending `WasmUpgradeProposal`, `ActiveDisputeCount == 0`, and `ActiveRecurringCount == 0`.

**Views / control:** `get_emergency_operation`, `get_emergency_operation_history`, `abort_emergency_operation`, `get_fund_allocation`, `get_active_dispute_count`, `get_active_recurring_count`.

**Partial recovery:** abort a parked `AdminRecovery` (clears the timelock) then start a new emergency sequence, or wait out the timelock and complete.

---

## 7. Admin Key Management

### Standard rotation (two-step transfer)

Admin rotation uses a two-step co-signing flow to ensure the incoming key is live and controlled:

1. Current admin calls `update_admin(new_admin)` — both the current admin and the new admin must authorize this transaction simultaneously.
2. New admin calls `claim_admin()` to finalize the transfer.

The current admin can abort the pending transfer at any time with `cancel_admin_transfer`. Both steps emit audit events on the `admin_change` topic.

**Assumption:** The self-address (`env.current_contract_address()`) is rejected as an admin address by `validate_admin_address`. This prevents the contract from being locked into an uncontrollable state.

---

## 8. Audit Trail and History

All upgrade lifecycle events are published to the `wasm_upgrade` event topic:

| Symbol | Event | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `UPG_PROP` | Proposal committed | Threshold reached in `propose_upgrade_wasm` |
| `UPG_CANC` | Proposal cancelled | `cancel_upgrade_wasm` called |
| `UPG_EXEC` | Upgrade executed | `execute_upgrade` succeeded |

Each event includes the WASM hash, the admin/signer address, the current ledger timestamp, and the scheduled `upgrade_at` time.

The on-chain `UpgradeHistory` log (readable via `get_upgrade_history`) retains up to **32** records. Once the cap is reached, the oldest entry is dropped (FIFO). For long-term compliance or forensic audit trails, operators should mirror `wasm_upgrade` events to off-chain storage.

`get_version` and `get_version_info` return the current `ContractVersion` counter, which increments by exactly 1 for each successful execution.

---

## 9. Security Assumptions and Invariants

The upgrade model relies on the following assumptions. Violating them weakens the security guarantees:

| # | Assumption | Risk if violated |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The admin key is held in a hardware or multi-sig wallet, not a hot wallet | A compromised admin key can cancel, re-propose, and execute any upgrade without signer cooperation if threshold=1 |
| 2 | The UpgradeSigners list is maintained and rotated as personnel changes | Removed signers cannot accumulate approvals once rotated off the list, but stale keys still exist on-chain until explicitly replaced |
| 3 | The 7-day cooldown is sufficient review time for the community/security team | Malicious code changes require more than 7 days to detect if the audit pipeline is slow |
| 4 | The `expected_wasm_hash` passed to `execute_upgrade` is verified off-chain before signing | The on-chain check is defense-in-depth; the admin must also independently verify the WASM contents match the intended changes |
| 5 | The fallback admin key is stored separately from the primary admin key | If both keys are stored together, a single compromise defeats the recovery mechanism |
| 6 | Off-chain monitoring of `wasm_upgrade` events is active | Without monitoring, a proposal could be committed and executed within the cooldown window without any human review |
| 7 | The threshold is set to at least 2 for production deployments | A threshold of 1 (default) means a single signer key compromise is sufficient to commit an upgrade proposal |
